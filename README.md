# Healthchatbot
The chatbots are conversational virtual assistants which automate interactions with the users.
Chatbots are powered by artificial intelligence using machine learning techniques to
understand natural language. The main motive of the paper is to help the users with minor
health information. Initially when the user visits the website first register themselves and later
can ask the bot their queries. The system uses an expert system to answer the queries if the
answer is not present in the database. Here the domain experts also should register
themselves by giving various details. The data of the chatbot is stored in the database in the
form of a pattern template.
